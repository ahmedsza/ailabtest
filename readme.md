## Details of Each Step

### [Step 1 – Code Interpreter Agent (Python)](step1.md)
Demonstrates how to create a Python-based code interpreter agent that executes code, saves its output to a file, and provides a download link.

### [Step 2 – File Search Agent (Python)](step2.md)
Guides you to create an agent that uploads a file, constructs a vector store, and searches within the file's content via a file search tool.

### [Step 3 – Web Search Agent with AutoGen (Python)](step3.md)
Shows how to build a web search agent using AutoGen with Bing Grounding to retrieve information from the web.

### [Step 4 – Orchestrating AI Agents with AutoGen (Python)](step4.md)
Orchestrates multiple AI agents (for search, blog writing, and saving) to complete a blog writing task through coordinated teamwork.

### [Step 5 – Code Interpreter Agent (C#)](step5.md)
Illustrates creating a C# console application that generates blog content. The agent writes Python code to produce a markdown file and then provides a download link.

### [Step 6 – File Upload & Search Agent (C#)](step6.md)
Demonstrates how to build a C# application that uploads files, creates a vector store, and uses it to perform file searches.

### [Step 7 – Bing Grounding Web Search Agent (C#)](step7.md)
Shows you how to construct a C# agent that employs Bing Grounding for conducting web searches and retrieving relevant results.

### [Step 8 – Semantic Kernel with Bing Grounding (C#)](step8.md)
Integrates Semantic Kernel with Azure OpenAI Chat Completion and Bing Grounding in a C# console app for advanced search and chat capabilities.

### [Step 9 – Enhanced Semantic Kernel Agent (C#)](step9.md)
Extends the Semantic Kernel integration by providing an enhanced setup that details configuration and execution for a complete AI agent run.
